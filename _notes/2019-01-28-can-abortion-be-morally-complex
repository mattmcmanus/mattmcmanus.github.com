There’s a phrase Jesus says to the religious authorities criticizing him that has became a major cornerstone of my ethical understanding. He says, “The Sabbath was made for humanity, not humanity for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27). I think the principle applies to every moral question. The point of moral laws and norms is to serve the best interests of people. Because the universe is complex, sometimes a moral law that is mostly universal needs to be tweaked in a unique circumstance in order to do what is most loving. Holding onto rigid absolutes does not represent a fidelity to divine truth so much as a fidelity to oversimplifying divine truth.
