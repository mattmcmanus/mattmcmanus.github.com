* Surprised by his optimism and the strength of character he has to intentionally keep bitterness at bay. His view of his hardships feel almost naive, and that is really refreshing. Itâ€™s as if the hatred of the KKK and others did not effect him
* His popularity and influence are unsurprising. He seems quite the man
* Is ideas on dignity are refreshing. The quote from Douglas about how no one can take your dignity, those who try to do so only take it from themselves.
* His clarity on the cost of slavery to the whites is even more clear than Debois. Specifically the destructive belief that you can somehow be above labor
* His views of and relationship with the general is inspiring
