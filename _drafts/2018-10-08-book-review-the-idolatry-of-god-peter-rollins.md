Roland starts the book by discussing his interpretation of original sin. Sin, being separation from God, heâ€™s originally from those early months in our life where we develop our sense of self. With the development of that sense of self as a profound sense of loss because now there is things that are not of our self. Interprets most of sin as our actions to try to fill that void that started when we became ourselves

He gives an example of three Brothers longing to make $10 million. For each brother the results of that search is emptiness. He also brings up the analogy of how much worship music is no different from regular pop music all have an object in which they seek to make their life worth living.
